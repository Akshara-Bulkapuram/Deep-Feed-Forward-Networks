## Assignment-2 (Deep Feed Forward Networks)

Download any binary classification dataset of your choice and implement the classifier using any feed forward neural network with two kind of architectures 

Start with a large number of units in first layer and then narrow down till classification layer is reached.

Start with an initial set of units in first layer and then increase till a predefined set of units in a higher layer and then narrow down till classification layer is reached.

Compare/Compute accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, metrics for Train, Validation and Test sets and visualize the same for different architecture.
